<p>A Curriculum Vitae (CV) resembles a resume in many ways, but is more specifically focused on
   academic achievements. A CV summarizes educational and academic history, and may include details
   about teaching experience, publications (books, articles, research papers, unpublished manuscripts, or
   book chapters), and academic honors and awards. Use a CV, rather than a resume, for teaching or
   research opportunities, applying for fellowships, or for further academic training.
   Some research positions in industry may also prefer a CV rather than a resume.
